The Page Removal Program requires three inputs"
1. The number of frames
2. The length of the reference input
3. The integer contents of the reference input

If the contents of the reference input is not an integer, the Program will exit out and you will have to restart with valid inputs

The outputs you will recieve are:

A graphical representaion of the memory at the end of the Page Removal using the designated Algorithm
The Number of Hits
The Number of Faults
The Hit Ratio
The Miss Ratio

Inputs to show correctness for FIFO:

Number of frames: 4
Length of reference input: 13
Contents of reference input: 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2

Output:

  7  7  7  7  7  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3
 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  4  4  4  4  4  4
 -1 -1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0
 -1 -1 -1  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2
The number of Hits: 6
The number of Faults: 7
Hit Ratio: 0.46153846
Miss ratio: 0.53846157


Inputs to show correctness for LRU:

Number of frames: 4
Length of reference input: 13
Contents of reference input: 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2

Output:

  7  7  7  7  7  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3
 -1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
 -1 -1  1  1  1  1  1  4  4  4  4  4  4
 -1 -1 -1  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2
The number of Hits: 7
The number of Faults: 6
Hit Ratio: 0.53846157
Miss ratio: 0.46153843

Conclusion:
LRU has a better Hit ratio when comapred to FIFO
