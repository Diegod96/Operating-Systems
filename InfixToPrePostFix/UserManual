    1. Please enter a valid expression
    2. No random characters, functions, or letters
    3. Please enter an expression that is longer than "1+2"
    4. Please seperate all operands and operators with spaces
        Example: "2 + 5 * 3 + 1 ^ 6 - 7"

As a result of following the directions provided above, you will receive your expression in postfix and prefix notation as well as the answer of the expression and a tree representation
of the expression entered in bracket notation.

Example: -(+(1,3)*(^(6,7)5) is equal to:

              -
        +           *
    1      3     ^     5
                6  7
